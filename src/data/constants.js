I automated API verifications through data-driven inputs and scripts, which helped simplify release verification and increase integration robustness. I was also involved in working with the QA and engineering groups in documenting scenarios, communicating insights, and increasing testing maturity, thus decreasing post-release defects and overall delivery robustness.",
